LMS-NPRR research note

1. One point you may be interested in: To how much extent should LMS inline foreach? Expand code every foreach call site as possible or use while-loop anywhere?
*2. Your problem may not be applicable to worst-case analysis. NPRR is a worst-case optimal algorithm, but...?

TODO:
	1. try inline / not inline intersection in EmptyHeaded
	2. fix TrieBuilder
	3. Multithreading: build trie in each thread and merge them back into one trie

	1. LMS-verify + query compiler =  High performance + high-level guarantees. How to verify it?
	2. Keeping experimenting with LMS-nprr. More joins, more layouts...
