	1. array_copy causes error in code writing phase. Illegal sharing of mutable objects. 
	2. arr foreach { e => e foreach { print } } Error: don't know how to generate code.
	ArrayForeach(Sym(237),Sym(258),Block(Sym(261))
	3. var arr = vector.map { v => NewArray[Int](length) } gives ""Could not find implicit value for evidence parameter" error message

Cause: 
	1. these features are not supported for generating C code
	2. Typ[Vector[Rep[Array[Int]]]] doen'st exist. It should be Typ[Rep[...]]. So 2-d array can be Rep[Array[Array[Int]]]

	4. The illegal sharing problem is still unknown. But it doesn't affect code gen....

	5. [error] (run-main-0) java.lang.StackOverflowError When I'm trying to write some recursive functions. I guess it's because Scala can't analysis when it will terminate?

	6. seg fault on large data: array out of bound. don't forget to modify array initial size. (solution: make them more like array buffer)

	7. Be careful when doing bitwise operation. Do it on unsigned long long if possible.
